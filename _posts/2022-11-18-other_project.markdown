title: "Sludge (voxel game)"
---

for a week long game jam me and my brothers made a voxel game. the biggest failiure was the scope, we didn't have enough time to polish the game to make it really fun. I had spent a while developing a multiplayer system that would be infinitely expandable.

My role in this project was making sure the rest of the game worked, while my brothers learned the voxel engine.
