The hardest part of this game was getting more used to the godot game engine.
The biggest success for me was the multiplayer found in the github version. However also a success was having a completed game with multiple levels.

Boolean circuit was a game we also made for a game jam. You can play the game jam version here.

There is also a more updated but also unfinished version on github.
