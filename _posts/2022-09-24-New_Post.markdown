title: "incomplete spaceship game"
---

this is a space game I made over a week or two. the hardest part of this project was gravity. the biggest success was completing gravity, however in the end I decided that gravity made the game less fun. it didn't take too long and it was fun using some asset packs.

as of right now I have some paid assests on this git repo so I can't make it public.
